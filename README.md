# RestAssured Examples

Project using the ServeRest public training API for tests (https://serverest.dev/) for building examples of RestAssured use.

The project has no defined pattern for all examples implemented, the idea is to show different ways of using RestAssured as a REST APIs testing framework.

For running the tests using Maven, you should:
```aidl
mvn clean compile test
```

Or simple:
```aidl
mvn test
```

The project is currently using Github actions for running the tests and generating Allure Reports, you can check it out on the .github folder.
